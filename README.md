# jasonkarns/homebrew

This is a [Homebrew Tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) providing miscellaneous formulae I find useful.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install jasonkarns/homebrew/<formula>`

Or `brew tap jasonkarns/homebrew` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonkarns/homebrew-homebrew/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
